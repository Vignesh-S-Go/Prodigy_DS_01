# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship — Task 1

## 📄 Task Overview
Welcome to my submission for **Task 1** of the **Data Science Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**.  

In this task, I have performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a provided dataset, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the **`world_population`**.  
It contains records of population from the year **2001 to 2022**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for Visualization

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

### ✔️ Data Cleaning
- Checked for **missing values**, **duplicates**, and **outliers** in the dataset.
- Handled them appropriately to ensure clean and reliable data for analysis.

### ✔️ Visualization
- Created:
  - **Bar Charts**
  - **Stacked Charts**  
to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable effectively.
